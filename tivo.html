    <p class="indented">This is the main live sports app. It lets you watch any sports (if you have the plan), pay-per-views like UFC, and many TV channels, as well. You will need to have your IP unlocked for this to work, steps are in the Setup area below.</p>

    <p class="indented">This app has lots of free movies and TV shows. It works mostly like Netflix and other apps. You can see popular stuff on the main page or use the search on the left. Because these videos can get taken down, some of the videos may not work and will show a "Links not found" error. You can try them later. This is a bonus app, so don't rely on it working all the time.</p>

    <p class="indented">This is a YouTube app that works just like the normal YouTube app, but without ads.</p>

    <p class="indented">Use this app to install new apps if you want, like other streaming apps for TV/Movies, like Netflix, Hulu, Sling, etc. You'll need your own subscriptions for those.</p>
    <h3>Streaming section</h3>
    <p class="indented">This section includes pre-installed apps that come with the Tivo stick. They can be removed, but they are hard to add back if they are removed, so I left them here in case you wanted to use them. You will need a real subscription for anything here.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <h1>First Setup</h1>
    <h2>Connecting to Wi-Fi</h2>
    <p class="indented">You will need to connect the Tivo to your home wi-fi network. To do this, at the main menu with all the apps on it, press and hold down the OK button on an app, then go to Android settings, and then to "Network &amp; Internet". Then choose your Wi-Fi network and login. Once connected to Wi-Fi, all of your apps should work, except S4U, which needs another step.</p>
    <h2>Unlocking the S4U App</h2>
    <p class="indented">The S4U app is locked to your location, so the accounts can't be shared. You will need to send your IP address to me so that I can link it to your account, which I can do remotely. The easiest way to get your IP Address is to open the S4U app. It will show on the top left "No Access | 123.123.123.123" where the set of numbers is your IP address. Send that IP to me somehow and I will link it to your account. Once that is done, you can go to Manual Refresh and it will load all of the sports. This only needs to be done once, unless you change Internet providers.</p>
